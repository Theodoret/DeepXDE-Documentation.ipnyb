# DeepXDE-Documentation.ipnyb
A DeepXDE .ipnyb version documentation from [Source](https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Credits go to corresponding authors.

This repository contains some retype codes, version from [original](https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Sequence reorder has been made to accomodate google colab (.ipnyb) execution and the execution results are saved. Some typo fixes have been done but other typo might be introduced due the fix method is by retyping most of entire document.
